Make this build on Travis and deploy a zip file with a run.bat and run.sh script
Turn more blocks into stone
Fix anvil setData calls
Reset villager health (or increase)
Record last place for infinite torch (it changes places)
Cook zombie meat to make raw mutton
Make enemies change targets every 20 or so seconds
If any attacker gets way outside the zone, teleport them back (ender dragons...)
No flint/steel above
No dispsense above
Blazes don't really move (add slithering ankle biters)
Wave bar doesn't go away at the end
Wither glitches out and stays in one place (don't push it as hard...)

Get rid of anvil wave
More ender dragons (harder.. ender mites?)
Move blazes up to the first section (fire!)
Collect arrows from arrow wave

Add enemy buffs to format
Separate out armor and all equipment slots (let user customize)
 - Still make simple slots to fill out 'full armor set'

Customized loot per enemy wave
Customized names (overhead)

Customize initial loot

You must kill waves before day can come (true/false flag on wave)

Transfer current config settings over to json

Config should control the world setup
 - fixed seed is optional
 - can even control what types of worlds are created + generators

Fireworks after beating the game (just test fireworks using a command, to test ending use goto command)
 - make one of those songs play

Remove 'how to play book', instead add special /cd-help [1-9] command
 - Make all commands /cd
 - Include suggestions like battlements
 - Also building main storage down below the ground to avoid ender dragons + buckets work
 - Mining obsidian
 - Include breakable values of different blocks (eg cooked stone)
 - Also include disenchantment table and values

make mob properties - speed, damage, immunities, only killable when, etc (override or scalars)
 - immunities could also be to certain types of swords
 - also can restrict 'only damage from fire, only damage from wooden swords, only damaged by punching, etc'

Make it so you can fill an exp bottle (poor exchange rate, but sacrifice!)

make pistons not able to push blocks over the siege path
 - or push the siege path back (adminium stops pushing blocks)
 - or make pistons not really work
 - or just auto clear the path before and after we run

reduce damage done by iron golemns slightly

handle all mob friendly fire (snowballs, arrows, blaze charges, its another entity!)

have the game joinable before running
 - lock the player out?

detect if the ocean is at 0,0 (if so, reroll the world or change the spawn location?)
 - server.unloadWorld - delete it, reroll
 - config item for 'minimum-land' - set to 0 to allow all ocean, generally never set to 1 (0.2 default)

make random patches in nether into soul sand
plant netherwart on soul sand (block populator)

legit pause? timescale mostly works (cooking...)

config option to control weather

Make individual waves able to say 'just target players' or 'just target villagers' / both, etc (add enum, default to BOTH)

boolean option for villager friendly fire in config

If enemies go outside, teleport them back in (maybe a little padding, but needs to include siege path and spawn area)
 - or make them retarget another player

All enemies killed message - CAREFUL - we don't want 'all killed' if we're slowly spawning them in
 - We'll consider rewarding the player when all enemies are killed, but for right now leave the award logic in the same place
 - Number of AIs left to kill (only when there's like 3... 2... 1...)

For an example in more customization of enemies:
 - http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/zarena/pages/custom-entity-yaml-files/

 - An option that says the night will wait until all enemies are killed

Make iron golemn wave, snowman wave (snowballs!), cat wave, chicken wave, mooshroom cow wave, etc

- Make the plugin work in a server (create new worlds for the plugin)
 - server.createWorld - just create a normal world and a nether, based on the string passed in
 - one game at a time, players must have nothing in inventory
 - once game is over, print out that it's over (but don't let recreation yet while running)
 - kick all players back to normal world (ideally same places)
 - don't allow rerunning while game in progress
 - force stop game command (with permissions I guess)

Ability for save / reload?

setup command permissions

make bat dropped xp a config item

More config options:
 - Hardcore
 - Ambient mob spawning

*******************************************************************
From old version:
Manual towers constructed differently - A dispenser + pressure plate
 - meant to sit directly on the ground where the attackers come from
 
Other potential types of towers
 - Teleporter randomly teleports an enemy (put Ender pearl into dispenser)
 - Shoots pearl out, if it hits, it teleports that enemy back to the start

Shot types
 - Any type of potion will be shot at the enemy (if negative)
 - Any type of potion will be shot at the players (if positive)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Start a game of craft defense
# SeedString is optional, omitting means use a randomly generated seed
# GameType is optional, omitting will choose the first game type defined in the config
# If cd-start command is issued and a game is running, the game will restart
# This will also overwrite any save data or saved worlds
/cd-start [SeedString] [GameType]

# Restarts the world and waves with the current seed and game type
/cd-restart

# Shuts down the current running game of Craft Defense
# Also deletes any existing world data created by Craft Defense
/cd-stop

/cd-save

# Loads an existing map along with wave data
/cd-load

# Joins the existing game of Craft Defense (or warns you if no game is running, to use /cd-start)
# The player must have an empty inventory and no armor in order to join
/cd-join

# Leaves a game of Craft Defense and teleports you back to
# your last known position, or the spawn point in the main world
/cd-leave

It would be somewhat nice if we could reboot a plugin / reload save data and keep playing
